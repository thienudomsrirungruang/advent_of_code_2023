# Advent of Code 2023

This file stores my solutions for AoC 2023. I don't wake up early enough to actually compete, but here are the times on days where I timed myself and tried to solve as fast as possible:

| Day | Part 1 | (exp. rank) | Part 1+2 | (exp. rank) |
| --- | ------ | ----------- | -------- | ----------- |
|   8 |   2:47 |          29 |     7:38 |          28 |
|  10 |  15:30 |        >100 |    32:14 |          72 |
|  11 |   5:25 |          56 |     8:56 |          84 |
|  12 |   8:12 |        >100 |    25:16 |        >100 |
|  13 |   7:30 |          53 |    13:11 |          82 |
|  14 |   5:09 |        >100 |    18:29 |        >100 |
|  15 |   5:11 |        >100 |    12:30 |        >100 |

### Other tidbits

`parser/` contains a clunky Haskell parser I wrote after day 2, but it's harder to use than just doing it normally.
